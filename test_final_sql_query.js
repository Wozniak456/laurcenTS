-- QUESTION: "Can we perform feeding operations on July 30, 2025 for location 61?"
-- 
-- This query checks if there are any POSTED documents AFTER July 30, 2025 that would BLOCK operations
-- on that earlier date. The logic is: "If there are posted operations on later dates, 
-- we cannot perform operations on earlier dates" (to maintain data integrity).
--
-- WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR:
-- 1. Documents for location 61
-- 2. That have a date AFTER July 30, 2025 (23:59:59.999)
-- 3. That are POSTED (date_time_posted IS NOT NULL)
-- 4. But EXCLUDING certain document types that shouldn't block operations
--
-- EXCLUSIONS (documents that DON'T block operations):
-- - Feeding calculation documents (doc_type_id != 7) - these are just recalculations
-- - Child documents (parent_document IS NULL) - these are derived from parent operations
-- - Stocking documents (doc_type_id = 1) that ONLY have transactions with the SAME location_id
--   (these are just reorganizing existing fish, not adding new fish)
--
-- RESULT INTERPRETATION:
-- - If query returns 0 rows: ‚úÖ Feeding is ALLOWED on July 30, 2025
-- - If query returns >0 rows: ‚ùå Feeding is BLOCKED on July 30, 2025
